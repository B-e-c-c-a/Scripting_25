        <h2> Hello there!</h2>
        <p>I have Placed Elizabeth in a world not much different from the DnD Canon, and no, she is not a DnD Character.
            She stands around 5'7", has shoulder length red hair and greenish eyes. her name comes from mine!
            "Elizabeth" is my middle name. personality wise, she is chipper and excited to meet everybody, no matter
            what species, race, class, age or patron she may encounter.
            Elizabeth or "Eli" as most townfolk call her runs her little tavern in the middle of a village where
            travellers frequent near daily. visit <a href="https://youtu.be/ADzazbh1WG0" target="_blank"> this link</a>
            to hear what inspired her!
            <br>
            <br>
            She enjoys lounging about when not in her tavern, humming songs from her youth, and often wanders about the
            forest where her cottage is nestled in a willow tree.
            <br>
            when in the tavern, she royally adores when bards come in to offer ambience to her already cheerful
            establishment. she finds joy in the challenges of serving others she doesn't normally see. Ever the
            extrovert, she will take any chance to get to know anyone, or anything better. that is how she met Esmryl.

            <br>
            <br>
            She does NOT like it, however, when anyone interrupts her. she sees it as one of the worst kinds of
            disrespect, and has to count to five so she won't explode.
            <br>
            she hates when anything stray touches her exposed skin and tricks her brain into thinking a bug crawled on
            her. she hates bugs. especially centipedes and roaches.
            during her daily work, she has to mend a lot of her garments. she thinks it's tedious, and one can often
            hear her grumbling before she reluctantly picks up a spool of thread and a needle.
            as much of an extrovert as she is, she despises being hit on by those less savory. or being hit on in
            general. she is taken, thank you very much!

        <h3> physical appearance and clothing</h3>
        <p>In her first designs, I made Elizabeth very easy for me to cosplay. so this meant a white blouse, black and
            red corset, all overtop a black maxi skirt. to finish her, I would wear my silicone elf ears and adopt a
            happy-go-lucky persona. in the image below, I experimented with the idea of her wearing flouncy dresses. I
            live vicariously through her, fashion-wise. </p>

        <h4>history!</h4>
        <p>As her story progressed as more of a personal OC and story, I have a little bit of Backstory for her
            character that is not nearly complete. however, I do have the bare bones of her lore. she was raised in a forest until she was seven. after that point, her home was raided, and she was taken in as "Livestock." over the years, she was passed from home to home, until she landed in this tavern, where she is abound until someone can get her out safely.

    <h3>The history of the hubby.</h3>
    <section id="Relationships">
        <p>Over the course of the last few years, I have changed Elizabeth's love interest many a time. at first I
            thought I should have her with another elf. teifling? Giant?? Eventually, I did decide on a more...
            unconventional option among the fantastical creatures. unconventional in the eyes of many, in the story and
            in my peer group, as I've found. I have her with a centaur. The design of this Equine suitor changed several
            times, and remained nameless for a long, long while. soon, I settled on a draft horse taur whom I called
            "Dallas." yes... the most horse name to ever horse. But now, as I am actively writing for the two, I changed
            her lover yet again, and I would not be surprised if I change it again. but now... her lover is a lovely
            unicorn taur called Esmryl. (EZZ-Murl) forgive me for the weird fantasy name. below I have two images, one
            of Dallas, and the other, Esmryl.</p>
