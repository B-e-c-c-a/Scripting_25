                        <div class="textbox">
                            <p>Rebecca Elizabeth Schmidt is a first year student at the Lethbridge Polytechnic,
                                focused
                                and enamored with writing and coding.

                                She often enjoys staying in and reading her Bible, writing blurbs for the
                                characters she
                                creates, drawing and crafting with her hands. That is why she enrolled into the
                                multimedia production program, to take her characters and make them into comic
                                characters for a published book. Her doll creation is a way to fully
                                conceptualize her
                                “Little Guys” and visualize them as a physical entity rather than a static
                                drawing.
                            </p>
                            <p>Rebecca didn’t enjoy public school much, her only solace was art class, even if
                                the
                                instructor openly disliked her and her faith. In that class, she was free to
                                paint and
                                draw as she wished, with little judgement for her inspiration.

                                As she has grown in her faith, she is finding ways to put scripture into her
                                writing and
                                her characters, especially the books “psalms” and “Galatians”. Those books have
                                spoken
                                to her since her first year at Millar College of the Bible, where she kept
                                learning more
                                about herself and the Book she had learned about since she was little.

                            </p>
                            <p>Her family has been nothing but a support for her, lovingly pointing out her
                                shortcomings
                                and raising her to be better, living out Galatians 6:1. She has one younger
                                sister, and
                                a close friend whom she calls her older brother.

                                A few things have remained a constant in her life. Her faith, her drawing, and
                                her love
                                of music. Her love of music seems to be the most prominent, as she learned to
                                sing at a
                                very early age because of her Christian lifestyle and influence. Because of
                                this, she
                                was encouraged to pursue it in choir and by singing on her family’s worship team
                                some
                                Sundays. Within this bubble of song, she and her parents make a three-part
                                choir.
                                Rebecca as the Soprano, her mother as the alto/Melody, and her father as the
                                bass.
                                Rebecca’s mother often teases her about finding a tenor to complete the quartet.
